# To Tickâœ…, a simple working to-do list manager website
## Your all in one, simple, seamless and easy-to-use to-do list service!
To Tick is a simple website that I've developed and worked on as a practice on learning express framework, MongoDB, Mongoose and Pug templating engine.
The website enables you to create a list, add tasks to it and mark them as done when you acheive them,
the website also comes with an authentication system that allows you to sign up to create a new user, you can also change your basic information (your name and profile picture) using the profile page,
you can also change your password by sending reset password link to your email, I used mailtrap as a mail service for learning purposes, but you can use any mail service you want.
The website also comes with an api that you can use to access the all of the features of the website, the api documentation is provided below ðŸ”½.
